## Taras Lysyi

Software engineer. Five years building production systems — distributed
services, real-time data pipelines, and AI integrations that do something
genuinely useful in production, not just wrappers around APIs.

---

### What I build

- Production microservices handling sensitive data at scale (Go, Encore)
- LLM integrations — real-time summarization, structured data extraction,
  tool-use pipelines with MCP servers (Gemini, Claude, Anthropic API)
- AI agents that connect to live systems and actually solve domain problems

---

### How I work with AI

I integrate LLMs where they earn their complexity — not chatbots, but
systems where AI processes real data, produces structured output, and
plugs into existing service architecture. MCP servers, tool-use patterns,
context-aware agents.

---

### Stack

Go, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Kafka, gRPC.
